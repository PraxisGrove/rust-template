# Application Types

This repository is a single Rust workspace template. It does not keep separate
generated profile directories.

When starting a real project, choose one application type and evolve the
workspace in that direction.

## Supported Directions

| Type | Use when | Default stack |
|---|---|---|
| Server plus full-stack frontend | The product needs an HTTP API and browser UI written primarily in Rust. | `tokio`, `axum`, `leptos`, `tracing`, OpenTelemetry, `sqlx`, PostgreSQL. |
| Server plus desktop client | The product needs a backend and an installed desktop app. | Server stack plus `tauri`; share contracts through a dedicated crate. |
| Desktop-only app | The product is local-first or does not need a hosted backend. | `tauri`, Rust command handlers, local `infra` adapters, optional SQLite with `sqlx`. |
| Server-only service | The product is an API, worker, or backend service. | `tokio`, `axum`, `tower`, `tracing`, OpenTelemetry, `sqlx`, PostgreSQL. |
| CLI/TUI app | The product is a command-line tool, developer tool, or terminal UI. | `clap`, `anyhow`, `thiserror`, `tracing`, optional `ratatui` and `crossterm`. |

## Selection Rules

- Pick server-only when the product has no user-facing installed or browser UI.
- Pick server plus full-stack frontend when Rust should own both the backend and
  the web UI.
- Pick desktop-only when the app can run locally without a hosted backend.
- Pick server plus desktop client when the desktop app depends on hosted state,
  sync, billing, accounts, or shared team data.
- Pick CLI/TUI when the main interface is a shell command or interactive
  terminal workflow.

## Policy

- Keep the base template dependency-light.
- Do not add framework dependencies for every possible application type.
- Add dependencies when the chosen application type actually needs them.
- Keep `domain`, `app`, `infra`, `cli`, and `xtask` boundaries unless there is
  a concrete reason to split or rename crates.
- Document application-specific choices in `docs/technology-stack.md` and
  `docs/architecture.md` when the project commits to them.
